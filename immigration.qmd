Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$

# Summary:
Attitudes toward immigration are an increasingly important part of US congressional elections. Using data from a 2012 experiment among Boston commuters, we seek to explore the causal effect of exposure to Spanish speakers on attitudes toward immigration among registered voters in Georgia today. However, the modelâ€™s conclusions may be limited due to changes in public opinion since 2012, which could affect the stability of relationships found in the original data.We model voter attitudes, measured on a continuous scale, as a linear function of whether a person was exposed to Spanish speakers during the experiment.
